Memory Management:
  In operating systems, memory management is the process of managing the primary memory space. There are several methods of doing this some of which are static and dynamic loading,
  memory swapping, static and dynamic linking, memory allocation, fragmentation, paging and a few others. The purpose of these is to move memory back and forth between main 
  memory and disk while the operating is running. This is so that the computer always has a decent amount of memory and wont lag or crash.
